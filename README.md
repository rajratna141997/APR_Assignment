# üìò Support Vector Machines (SVM) Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on applying **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** for classification tasks as part of the *Advanced Pattern Recognition* coursework.

SVM is one of the most powerful supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression. The central idea is to find an **optimal separating hyperplane** that best divides the data into classes while maximizing the margin between them.

The purpose of this project is to:

* Understand the working principle of SVMs.
* Preprocess and prepare a dataset for classification.
* Train and evaluate an SVM classifier.
* Analyze results using performance metrics and visualizations.

Through this project, we gained practical insights into how kernel functions and feature scaling affect classification performance.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains multiple features and target class labels. It was preprocessed before training the model.

Key steps applied to the dataset:

* **Data Cleaning:** Removed irrelevant or noisy data.
* **Label Encoding:** Converted categorical labels into numeric values suitable for machine learning models.
* **Feature Scaling:** Applied normalization and standardization to bring all feature values into a comparable range, which is crucial for SVM performance.
* **Splitting:** Divided the dataset into **training (70%)** and **testing (30%)** subsets to evaluate the model fairly.

This dataset allowed us to test SVM‚Äôs capability to separate classes in a feature space effectively.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project followed a structured workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Encoded categorical variables into numerical form.
   * Scaled features using both *Min-Max Scaling* and *Standard Scaling*.
   * Visualized data distribution to understand class balance and feature correlations.

2. **Model Training with SVM**

   * Implemented **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** from scikit-learn.
   * Explored different kernel functions such as **Linear Kernel** and **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel**.
   * Experimented with parameters like **C** (regularization) and **gamma** (influence of single training examples) to optimize performance.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**

   * Accuracy score to measure overall correctness.
   * Confusion matrix to analyze misclassifications.
   * Classification report showing precision, recall, and F1-score.
   * Visualizations of decision boundaries to demonstrate how SVM separates classes.

## üìä Results

The evaluation showed that:

* The **accuracy** of the SVM classifier was high, indicating that the model successfully classified most samples.
* The **confusion matrix** revealed that the majority of predictions were correct, though some misclassifications occurred between closely related classes.
* The **classification report** highlighted strong performance with balanced precision and recall across classes.
* Visualization of the **decision boundary** clearly illustrated how SVM separates classes in feature space.

These results demonstrate the strength of SVM in handling classification tasks with proper preprocessing.

## üöÄ Applications of SVM

Support Vector Machines are widely used in real-world applications, including:

* **Text Classification:** Spam filtering, sentiment analysis, document categorization.
* **Image Recognition:** Handwritten digit recognition, facial recognition, and object detection.
* **Bioinformatics:** Classification of diseases such as cancer based on gene expression data.
* **Financial Predictions:** Fraud detection, credit risk classification, and stock market trend analysis.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

While SVMs are powerful, they come with certain limitations:

* **Scalability Issues:** Training SVMs on very large datasets is computationally expensive.
* **Kernel Selection:** Choosing the correct kernel function requires experimentation and domain knowledge.
* **Sensitivity to Parameters:** Performance depends heavily on hyperparameters like `C` and `gamma`.
* **Interpretability:** SVMs can be less interpretable compared to decision trees or rule-based models.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the use of **Support Vector Machines** for classification tasks.
The experiments confirmed that SVMs are capable of achieving strong accuracy and robust classification performance when the dataset is properly preprocessed.

The project also highlighted the importance of feature scaling and parameter tuning in ensuring that SVM performs optimally.

For future improvements, additional techniques could be explored, such as:

* **Hyperparameter Optimization** using Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization.
* **Cross-validation** for more reliable model evaluation.
* **Kernel Tricks** for handling more complex datasets that are not linearly separable.
